description: "ddev is an open source tool that makes it dead simple to get 
local PHP development environments up and running within minutes. It's 
powerful and flexible as a result of its per-project environment 
configurations, which can be extended, version controlled, and shared. In 
short, ddev aims to allow development teams to use Docker in their workflow 
without the complexities of bespoke configuration. Pluggable hosting 
providers with current support for Pantheon."
