description: "Dropwhale is a drop-in Docker environment aimed at Drupal module developers. Instead of maintaining a separate Drupal installation, Dropwhale does all the downloading and initialization of Drupal with a few easy commands. No need for you to download and install core. No need to argue with xdebug or get Drush installed. It's all built in!"
