description: "Command line to build JS files the way Drupal core does. Just create your JS files as [name].es6.js. When this tool is executed, those files will be compiled by Babel to [name].js. The script files were directly taken from Drupal core codebase and updated to support custom build configurations using the .drupalbuild.js file. The default configuration will match Drupal's default behaviour/convention."
