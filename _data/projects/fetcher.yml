description: "Fetcher is a Drush extension that automates the process of
provisioning a Drupal site on a local development environment or a server.
This includes setting up the Drupal root, fetching the code (generally from a VCS),
creating a database for the site and a user with the necessary privileges to
manage it, updating permissions, creating symlinks, setting up server configuration
files like Apache’s virtual hosts, and generating drush alias files for your
convenience. In addition, fetcher supports post installation tasks that can be
run after a site is setup."
