description: "Fetcher is a Drush extension that automates the process of provisioning a Drupal site on a local development environment or a server. This includes setting up the Drupal root, fetching the code (generally from a VCS), creating a database for the site and a user with the necessary privileges to manage it, updating permissions, creating symlinks, setting up server configuration files like Apacheâ€™s virtual hosts, and generating drush alias files for your convenience. In addition, fetcher supports post installation tasks that can be run after a site is setup."
