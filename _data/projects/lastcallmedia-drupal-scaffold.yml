description: "This is a boilerplate Drupal 8 build that bundles some standard tools to make it a good starting point for an enterprise scale Drupal build. It is conceptually similar to drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold, but it has a much simpler (and more manual) Composer setup, and includes additional tools."
