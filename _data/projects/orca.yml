description: "ORCA (Official Representative Customer Application) is a tool for testing a company Drupal-adjacent software packages. It ensures their cross compatibility and correct functioning by installing all of them together into a realistic, functioning, best practices Drupal build and running automated tests and static code analysis on them. Its guiding design principle is to use company packages as a customer would. It installs the latest recommended versions via composer and performs no manual setup or configuration."
