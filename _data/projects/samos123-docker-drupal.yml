description: "This image contains the latest stable Drupal 7-release. It will automatically setup the database and install a default site. The image doesn't contain a database so you have to create a seperate database container (which is no effort if you use the provided configuration for docker-compose) and link this container or pass the database information of a MySQL- or Postgres-host."
