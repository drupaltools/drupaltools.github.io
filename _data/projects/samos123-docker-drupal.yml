description: "This image contains the latest stable Drupal 7-release.
It will automatically setup the database and install a default site.
The image doesn't contain a database so you have to create a seperate database
container (which is no effort if you use the provided configuration for docker-compose)
and link this container or pass the database information of a MySQL- or Postgres-host."
