description: "Switchboard is a application for coordinating between local
environments and third-party hosts. Switchboard gets information about remote sites,
sets up local sites, and can be used to synchronize content between the local and remote.
Switchboard uses Drush for validation and input. All commands can respond with
Drush format (default), or with JSON output using option --json.
Switchboard currently supports operations on both Acquia and Pantheon sites."
