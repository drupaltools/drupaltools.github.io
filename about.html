# About DrupalTools

Drupal is a powerful content management system, or to be more accurate an advanced framework based in PHP.

Since 2000 Drupal became so popular and several tools appeared related to it, most of them Open Source.

Drush, Vagrant, Docker, Aegir, Drupal console, bash scripts and many other technologies were used by people to utilize Drupal projects
from configuration and development to deployment and sharing.

This project aims to unify all these tools under one domain mostly to help people **find the right tool** to accomplish a Drupal related task.

Categorizing tools is not easy as there are so many categories and different "fields" per category. Another issue is that some tools are maintaining on Github,
other on Drupal.org, other on Gitlab etc.
